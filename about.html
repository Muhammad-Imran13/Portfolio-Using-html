                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Muhammad Imran</strong>, and I’m a passionate student currently learning
                    <em>Web Development</em> and computer technologies.
                    From a very young age, I was fascinated by how websites work and how creative people turn simple
                    code into something beautiful and functional.</p>
                    

                <p>I enjoy working with <b>HTML</b>, <i>CSS</i>, and exploring the basics of <u>JavaScript</u>.
                    My goal is to become a full-stack developer who can build everything from simple landing pages to
                    complex web applications.</p>

                <p>In addition to coding, I have a deep interest in <strong>graphic design</strong> and <em>UI/UX</em>
                    concepts.
                    I believe that great design isn’t just about colors or shapes — it’s about making the user’s journey
                    enjoyable and effortless.</p>

                <p>Currently, I’m focusing on improving my fundamentals. I try to learn something new every day, whether
                    it's a small HTML tag, a new CSS trick, or understanding how databases work.
                    I strongly believe that <em>consistency</em> is the key to growth in the tech world.</p>

                <p>When I’m not coding, I like reading about technology trends, exploring creative ideas, and helping my
                    friends understand programming basics.
                    Teaching others helps me reinforce my own understanding.</p>

                <p>Besides technology, I have a great passion for <strong>reading books</strong>, especially <em>Islamic
                        history</em>.
                    I love learning about the lives of great scholars, the golden age of Muslim civilization, and the
                    wisdom of early Islamic thinkers.
                    Books like <q>Seerat-un-Nabi (ﷺ)</q>, <q>Tareekh-e-Tabari</q>, and <q>Hayatus Sahaba</q> inspire me
                    deeply and remind me of the moral and spiritual strength of our past.</p>

                <p>Reading such works gives me perspective on life, discipline, and leadership.
                    I believe every developer and learner should also read history to understand how knowledge and
                    ethics go hand in hand.</p>

                <p>I live by the quote <q>“Learning never exhausts the mind.”</q>
                    <cite>&#8722; Leonardo da Vinci</cite> — a constant reminder that knowledge is endless and curiosity is
                    the fuel that keeps us going.
                </p>

                <p>My long-term dream is to work on real-world projects that can make a difference — maybe build
                    educational platforms or creative portfolio tools for new learners.</p>

                <p>Besides tech and reading, I enjoy photography, music, and spending time with people who inspire
                    positivity and creativity.</p>

                <p><strong>In short:</strong> I’m a dreamer, a learner, and a builder — always curious, always growing,
                    and always ready to create something meaningful.</p>
